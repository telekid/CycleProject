{"name":"The Cycle Project","tagline":"Creating a free, high-quality, public domain sample library of important sounds from around the globe.","body":"# FAQ\r\n\r\n### How will you travel the globe?\r\nWe plan to primarily travel by motorcycle, which will help us keep costs down and our environmental impact low. The realities of global transit will of course mandate that we maintain flexibility in our travel plans, and we fully expect to travel via other means when necessary.\r\n\r\nWhenever possible, we will camp outside in a tent or under the stars. In urban areas, we will stay at hostels or in the homes of generous hosts. \r\n\r\n### Who are you?\r\n\r\n\r\n### What kinds of sounds are you looking to record?\r\nOur goal is to capture sounds that are particular or unique to specific regions, locations, cultures, people, and lifeforms. This includes \r\n\r\n### Where specifically do you plan on recording?\r\nRead more about our journey [here](). (TODO: Link to map page.)\r\n\r\n### How long will your journey take?\r\nFor every $60,000 we raise, we can spend approximately one year recording audio around the world. If we hit $120,000, we will travel the world for two years. If we hit $180,000, we will travel for three years. If we raise more than $180,000 and still have energy left after three years, we will continue to travel and record until our funds are exhausted.\r\n\r\n### How will you be spending our money?\r\nSee our budgetary breakdown here.\r\nTODO: Link to budget.\r\n\r\n### How will you record audio on the road?\r\nThere are numerous technical challenges associated with recording \r\nTODO: Finish this section.\r\n\r\n### When will audio be distributed?\r\nAudio will be released in seven cycles:\r\n* North America East\r\n* South America\r\n* Africa\r\n* Europe\r\n* The Middle East\r\n* Asia\r\n* North America West\r\n\r\nIt is expected that each cycle will be made available to the public approximately three months after the completion of recording in that particular region. This should provide our curators ample time to review, slice and tag the captured audio.\r\n\r\n### What will your recording process look like?\r\nWe will record in 24 bit, 96k [Broadcast WAV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_Wave_Format). \r\n\r\n### In what format will you deliver audio?\r\nWe will distribute audio in 24 bit, 96k [Broadcast WAV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_Wave_Format) and [FLAC](https://xiph.org/flac/).\r\n\r\n### How much audio will you record?\r\nOur goal is to record one hour of audio every day. If we reach our $60,000 one year goal, then we will return with over *15 days* of audio. Every dollar past that goal will allow us to slow down our journey and capture more audio in more places.\r\n\r\n### How will you distribute the content?\r\nAll samples will be made available via BitTorrent.\r\n\r\n### Why do you only offer direct digital downloads for backers of $100 or more?\r\nDigital media distribution is surprisingly expensive for large files. Assuming our sample library totals 120 GB, it will cost us over $5500 to distribute it to 500 users. See our [AWS S3 pricing report](https://calculator.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html#r=IAD&s=S3&key=calc-7E59DB91-F336-41F1-A930-F94C870F7B6E) for more details.\r\n\r\n### Will you edit or post-process the audio files?\r\nNo. We would rather provide you with the orignal, raw audio and let you make edits as necessary. We will not add fades, normalize, compress, de-noise, or otherwise modify the original recordings. \r\n\r\n### Why not record at 96k or 192k?\r\nFile size, mostly. Recording at 96k or 192k would effectively halve or quarter our recording time. In addition, there are very few perceptual benefits to recording at 96k. See the following technical articles and videos for more information:\r\n\r\n[xiph.org: A Digital Media Primer for Geeks](https://www.xiph.org/video/vid1.shtml)\r\n\r\n[xiph.org: Digital Show & Tell](https://www.xiph.org/video/vid2.shtml)\r\n\r\n[xiph.org: 24/192 Music Downloads](http://people.xiph.org/~xiphmont/demo/neil-young.html#toc_wd2bm)\r\n\r\n### How will your audio be licensed?\r\nWe are exploring various licensing models, but we are currently leaning towards Creative Commons CC0. The CC0 license has been designed as an internation Public Domain license. Read more at the [Creative Commons CC0] (https://creativecommons.org/about/cc0) information page. \r\n\r\n### What metadata will your audio files include?\r\nEvery audio file will be tagged with the recording's date, UTC time, geographical coordinates, and descriptive tags. We are also looking into programitacally converting UTC time into local time tags, and automatically converting date/coordinate tuples into geopolitical information like country and government.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
