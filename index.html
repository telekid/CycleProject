<h3>
<a name="how-will-you-travel-the-globe" class="anchor" href="#how-will-you-travel-the-globe"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How will you travel the globe?</h3>

<p>We plan to primarily travel by motorcycle, which will help us keep costs down and our environmental impact low. The realities of global transit will of course mandate that we maintain flexibility in our travel plans, and we fully expect to travel via other means when necessary.</p>

<p>Whenever possible, we will camp outside in a tent or under the stars. In urban areas, we will stay at hostels or in the homes of generous hosts. </p>

<p>Our goal is to capture sounds that are particular or unique to specific regions, locations, cultures, people, and lifeforms. This includes </p>

<p>Read more about our journey <a href="">here</a>. (TODO: Link to map page.)</p>

<h3>
<a name="how-long-will-your-journey-take" class="anchor" href="#how-long-will-your-journey-take"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How long will your journey take?</h3>

<p>For every $60,000 we raise, we can spend approximately one year recording audio around the world. If we hit $120,000, we will travel the world for two years. If we hit $180,000, we will travel for three years. If we raise more than $180,000 and still have energy left after three years, we will continue to travel and record until our funds are exhausted.</p>

<p>There are numerous technical challenges associated with recording 
TODO: Finish this section.</p>

<h3>
<a name="when-will-audio-be-distributed" class="anchor" href="#when-will-audio-be-distributed"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>When will audio be distributed?</h3>

<p>Audio will be released in seven cycles:</p>

<ul>
<li>North America East</li>
<li>South America</li>
<li>Africa</li>
<li>Europe</li>
<li>The Middle East</li>
<li>Asia</li>
<li>North America West</li>
</ul><p>It is expected that each cycle will be made available to the public approximately three months after the completion of recording in that particular region. This should provide our curators ample time to review, slice and tag the captured audio.</p>

<a name="what-will-your-recording-process-look-like" class="anchor" href="#what-will-your-recording-process-look-like"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What will your recording process look like?</h3>

<p>We will record in 24 bit, 96k <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_Wave_Format">Broadcast WAV</a>. </p>

<h3>
<a name="in-what-format-will-you-deliver-audio" class="anchor" href="#in-what-format-will-you-deliver-audio"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>In what format will you deliver audio?</h3>

<p>We will distribute audio in 24 bit, 96k <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_Wave_Format">Broadcast WAV</a> and <a href="https://xiph.org/flac/">FLAC</a>.</p>

<h3>
<a name="how-much-audio-will-you-record" class="anchor" href="#how-much-audio-will-you-record"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How much audio will you record?</h3>

<p>Our goal is to record one hour of audio every day. If we reach our $60,000 one year goal, then we will return with over <em>15 days</em> of audio. Every dollar past that goal will allow us to slow down our journey and capture more audio in more places.</p>

<h3>
<a name="how-will-you-distribute-the-content" class="anchor" href="#how-will-you-distribute-the-content"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How will you distribute the content?</h3>

<p>All samples will be made available via BitTorrent.</p>

<h3>
<a name="why-do-you-only-offer-direct-digital-downloads-for-backers-of-100-or-more" class="anchor" href="#why-do-you-only-offer-direct-digital-downloads-for-backers-of-100-or-more"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why do you only offer direct digital downloads for backers of $100 or more?</h3>

<p>Digital media distribution is surprisingly expensive for large files. Assuming our sample library totals 120 GB, it will cost us over $5500 to distribute it to 500 users. See our <a href="https://calculator.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html#r=IAD&amp;s=S3&amp;key=calc-7E59DB91-F336-41F1-A930-F94C870F7B6E">AWS S3 pricing report</a> for more details.</p>

<a name="will-you-edit-or-post-process-the-audio-files" class="anchor" href="#will-you-edit-or-post-process-the-audio-files"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Will you edit or post-process the audio files?</h3>

<p>No. We would rather provide you with the orignal, raw audio and let you make edits as necessary. We will not add fades, normalize, compress, de-noise, or otherwise modify the original recordings. </p>

<h3>
<a name="why-not-record-at-96k-or-192k" class="anchor" href="#why-not-record-at-96k-or-192k"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why not record at 96k or 192k?</h3>

<p>File size, mostly. Recording at 96k or 192k would effectively halve or quarter our recording time. In addition, there are very few perceptual benefits to recording at 96k. See the following technical articles and videos for more information:</p>

<a name="how-will-your-audio-be-licensed" class="anchor" href="#how-will-your-audio-be-licensed"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How will your audio be licensed?</h3>

<p>We are exploring various licensing models, but we are currently leaning towards Creative Commons CC0. The CC0 license has been designed as an internation Public Domain license. Read more at the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/about/cc0">Creative Commons CC0</a> information page. </p>

<a name="what-metadata-will-your-audio-files-include" class="anchor" href="#what-metadata-will-your-audio-files-include"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What metadata will your audio files include?</h3>

<p>Every audio file will be tagged with the recording's date, UTC time, geographical coordinates, and descriptive tags. We are also looking into programitacally converting UTC time into local time tags, and automatically converting date/coordinate tuples into geopolitical information like country and government.</p>
