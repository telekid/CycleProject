# FAQ

### How will you travel the globe?
We plan to primarily travel by motorcycle, which will help us keep costs down and our environmental impact low. The realities of global transit will of course mandate that we maintain flexibility in our travel plans, and we fully expect to travel via other means when necessary.

Whenever possible, we will camp outside in a tent or under the stars. In urban areas, we will stay at hostels or in the homes of generous hosts. 

### Who are you?

### Where specifically do you plan on recording?
Read more about our journey [here](). (TODO: Link to map page.)

### How long will your journey take?
For every $60,000 we raise, we can spend approximately one year recording audio around the world. If we hit $120,000, we will travel the world for two years. If we hit $180,000, we will travel for three years. If we raise more than $180,000 and still have energy left after three years, we will continue to travel and record until our funds are exhausted.

### What will your recording process look like?
We will record in 24 bit, 48k [Broadcast WAV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_Wave_Format). 

### In what format will you deliver audio?
We will distribute audio in 24 bit, 48k [Broadcast WAV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_Wave_Format) and [FLAC](https://xiph.org/flac/).

### How much audio will you record?
Our goal is to record one hour of audio every day. If we are funded for one year, then we will return with over *15 days* of audio. If we are funded for two years, we will return with a full month of continuous audio.

### How will you distribute the content?
All samples will be distributed via BitTorrent. In addition, we are currently seeking sponsorship from a variety of content distributors 

### Will you edit or post-process the audio files?
No. We would rather provide you with the orignal, raw audio and let you make edits as necessary. We will not add fades, normalize, compress, de-noise, or otherwise modify the original recordings. 

### Why not record at 96k or 192k?
File size, mostly. Recording at 96k or 192k would effectively halve or quarter our recording time. In addition, there are very few perceptual benefits to recording at 96k. See the following technical articles and videos for more information:

### How will your audio be licensed?
We are exploring various licensing models, but we are currently leaning towards Creative Commons CC0. The CC0 license has been designed as an internation Public Domain license. Read more at the [Creative Commons CC0] (https://creativecommons.org/about/cc0) information page. 

### What metadata will your audio files include?
Every audio file will be tagged with the recording's date, UTC time, geographical coordinates, and descriptive tags. We are also looking into programitacally converting UTC time into local time tags, and automatically converting date/coordinate tuples into geopolitical information like country and government.
